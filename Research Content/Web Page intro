Tools used in the tech to accomplish a goal are just as essential as the code itself from file sharing, 
communication, document processing and workflow if we didnâ€™t have these tools, we as developers wouldn't be able to do our jobs. 
These tools streamline the effort of coding and make collaboration among teams much more efficient.
As developers we need to communicate with those on our team and cross functional teams as well.
Tools in tech makes this easier and allows us to make sure the technology we are building works and is meeting the standards of all those involved.
