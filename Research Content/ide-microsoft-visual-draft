Microsoft Visual Studio is an IDE by Microsoft released in 2003. It has several built in languages including C/C++/C#, Javascript, 
HTML and CSS. Visual Studio also supports other languages like Python, Ruby and Node.js via plugins. 

Features in Visual Studio include IntelliSense, which is a tool that provides code suggestions if you get stuck on your project. 
CodeLens lets you see referential data on your code to help track changes made, the impact of changes made, and who made those 
changes as well as whether those changes have been tested. Visual Studio lets you pause code mid-execution to help identify and fix 
any bugs, as well as let you test your fixes/changes immediately mid typing. 

Visual Studio has several add-on integrations with other applications and resources such as Microsoftâ€™s Azure and Github, letting you 
easily communicate and collaborate with team members. There are also several pre-packaged component bundles available that were made 
for specific tasks like web development or mobile/gaming development.
