AGILE TOOLS: JIRA

Atlassian offers a number of programs and tools that are widely used in the Tech Industry, with Jira being the most notable.  Jira can be used to organize projects, track issues and tasks, monitor and customize workflows, among other things, which makes it very popular for Agile-based teams.

You can create issues which can be tasks to do, bugs to be fixed, or features to develop. Issues can be linked to each other and have labels for easy tracking.  These are frequently tracked on a Board, which can be either Scrum or Kanban style, and their progress tracked through from inception to deployment. Jira also provides excellent reporting options.
